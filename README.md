# Collective sanctions

An experiment aims to test if we would observe higher degree of cooperation and
more attempts to detect the lowest cooperator if non-whistleblowers (or non detectors)
will be punished alongside with the lowest cooperator.

## Design

The baseline decision situation upon which the whole design is constructed is a
Public Good Game with the punishment stage (following Fehr and Gaechter 1999).

What differs the current result from F&G is the punishment that can be imposed
only on the smallest contributor or contributors in a group.

## Treatments
There are the following treatments:

* A baseline treatment: after Stage 1 where the decisions of contributions have
been made, everyone observes the contributions of others and can 'detect' the smallest
contribution. The 'detection' is costly for detector, aka whistleblower. If the smallest contributor (TSC) is detected,
she receives a fine that decreases her earnings.

If TSC is 'detected' by more than one of other members of the group, then the TSC
is punished only once (hence: detection, not punishment).

If there are more than one TSC, for example if the set of contributions is: {5,5,18,20}
then in the case of detection only the detected TSC is punished.

If there are more than one TSC, then a TSC can detect another one.

* In a '**Collective sanctions I**' treatment if a person decides to 'detect' TSC,
then all non-detecting participants are punished as well. The cost of this detection
then varies depending on the number of non-detectors.

So, if in a group of 4, there was one detector, one TSC, and two non-detectors,
then a detector will pay three times a cost of detection.

If in a group of 4, there were three detectors and one TSC, then  each
detector will pay for detection only once.

If there is no detectors in a group, then nobody is punished.

* In a '**Collective sanctions II**' treatment the only difference with **Collective
sanctions I** is  that if there is no detectors in a group, then the entire group is punished.

* In a '**Collective sanctions III**' treatment if there is no detectors in a group, then the entire group is punished. But if there was at least one detection, then only TSC is punished.

## Addendum
* After finishing the game participants fill in the questionnaire, and play SVO measurement set of games.
* In some subtreatments after playing Baseline for _N_ rounds, the participants could choose whether to switch to collective sanctions regime, or to stay in a baseline. (think up more about the group composition).

## Whistleblowing
* there are two features of whistleblowing.
  * whistleblowing is a detection of an action, not a peer punishment. So it is enough that one person detects a TLS, to produce the punishment. If there are two detectors a person is not punished twice: like in a real life when the fact that two people blew the whistle does not mean that the perpetrator is punished twice.
  * the cost of whistleblowing depends on the number of whistleblowers in a group. It reaches its maximum when you are the only one, and its minimum if everyone else (apart from perpetrator) is ready to blow a whistle.

## Research question
we would to see if the introduction of collective sanctions would increase:
a) whistleblowing
b) cooperation rate
